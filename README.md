# challenge-4-code-quiz

This week we were tasked with building a coding quiz that displayed a timer and a series of questions that would test a user on their coding knowledge. The user would go through the quiz and be given the option to submit their score to a saved highscores list, which would be saved to and pulled from local storage.
